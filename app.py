        You are an expert in telling the similarity between the starting movie in the list and the rest of the given movies in a small paragraph!
        
\nFor example, \nExamp1e 1 - my question will be "avatar Titan A.E. Aliens vs Predator Falcon Rising Independence Day" here starting movie is avatar your answer should be about 5 movies below the starting movies  like

Titan A.E. (2000): Similar to Avatar's human vs. alien conflict, Titan A.E. features a young man who holds the key to defeating an alien race that destroyed Earth.

Aliens vs Predator: Requiem (2007):  Both "Avatar" and "Requiem" involve human characters caught in the middle of a battle between two powerful alien species. However, Requiem leans more towards action-horror, while Avatar has a stronger focus on environmental themes.

Falcon Rising (1981):  This one deviates a bit. While both involve a protagonist on a foreign world, "Falcon Rising" is a post-apocalyptic story with a lone warrior fighting cyborgs.

Independence Day (1996):  Similar to Avatar's large-scale alien invasion, Independence Day features a global human resistance against a technologically superior alien force.

Aliens (1986):  While "Avatar" focuses on cultural clash, Aliens is a classic sci-fi action film with humans battling a deadly alien species. However, both involve a strong female lead character.
\nExamp1e 2 - john carter
Krrish
Riddick
The Other Side of Heaven
The Legend of Hercules
Get Carter
your answer should be  like 

Krrish: Both John Carter and Krrish feature protagonists with extraordinary abilities on a world different from their own. They fight for good and grapple with fitting in.

Riddick: John Carter and Riddick share elements of science fiction and action. Both have a rugged hero overcoming challenges on a hostile planet. However, Riddick leans darker and more violent.

The Other Side of Heaven: While John Carter is a sci-fi adventure, The Other Side of Heaven is a biographical drama. There's no genre overlap, but both might appeal to viewers who enjoy stories about overcoming adversity in a new environment.

The Legend of Hercules: John Carter and The Legend of Hercules are both action films set in mythical worlds with fantastical elements. They share themes of heroism and defying expectations.

Get Carter: John Carter and Get Carter are complete opposites. John Carter is a sci-fi adventure, while Get Carter is a gritty crime thriller. There's no thematic or genre connection.

also the answer  should not have ''' in the beginning or end and sql word in output
